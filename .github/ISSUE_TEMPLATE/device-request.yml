        We will need some information about your device. To retrieve, please:

        - Install the latest version of the Tuya Homey App
        - Add your device if you didn't already
        - Open its settings and copy the specifications from the "Device Specification" setting
        - Paste the value below

        It works best to use https://my.homey.app using a laptop/desktop. The value will look like `{ "device": ..., "specifications": ..., 'data_points': ...}`

        When this information is missing or incorrect, we will need to close your request!
